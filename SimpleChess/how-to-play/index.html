    <h2>The Game</h2>
    <div class="text-container">
      <p>Before beginning a game of chess, the two players must decide who will play with the white pieces and who will play with the black pieces. If the players cannot make a unanimous decision, a coin can be flipped. To start the game, the player with the white pieces makes their first move. The player with the black pieces then follows suit. This alternation continues for the rest of the game. Each type of piece can move in a different fashion. This will be explained more thoroughly in the next section. If a piece lands on a square that is occupied by another piece, the new piece replaces the old piece. This is known as a capture. A player cannot capture their own pieces. If a piece moves and threatens to capture the opponent’s king, this is known as a check. If a player is in check, they must find a way to protect their king so that it cannot be captured. A player cannot make a move that puts their king in check. If a player puts their opponent in check and there is no legal way for their opponent to protect their king, the checking player wins the game. This situation is known as checkmate and is the goal of the game.</p>

    <h2>Pieces</h2>
    <div class="text-container">
      <p>The game of chess has six different types of pieces. These pieces include rooks, knights, bishops, queens, kings, and pawns.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-container">
      <h3>Rooks</h3>
      <img src="../assets/pieces/wR.svg" width="80">
      <img src="../assets/pieces/bR.svg" width="80">
      <p>A rook is often depicted as a tower or castle and can move vertically or horizontally. If a piece is in a rook’s path, it <strong>cannot</strong> go past it.</p>
      <img src="assets/images/rookmoves.png" class="board-demo">
      <h3>Knights</h3>
      <img src="../assets/pieces/wN.svg" width="80">
      <img src="../assets/pieces/bN.svg" width="80">
      <p>Knights have the appearance of a horse and can move in ‘L’ shapes. This can also be thought of as having the ability to move one square vertically and two squares horizontally or two squares vertically and one square horizontally. Knights <strong>can</strong> jump over pieces blocking their path.</p>
      <img src="assets/images/knightmoves.png" class="board-demo">
      <h3>Bishops</h3>
      <img src="../assets/pieces/wB.svg" width="80">
      <img src="../assets/pieces/bB.svg" width="80">
      <p>Bishops can move diagonally. They <strong>cannot</strong> move past pieces blocking their path.</p>
      <img src="assets/images/bishopmoves.png" class="board-demo">
      <h3>Queens</h3>
      <img src="../assets/pieces/wQ.svg" width="80">
      <img src="../assets/pieces/bQ.svg" width="80">
      <p>Queens can move diagonally, horizontally, and vertically. This can be thought of as the combined functionality of both a rook and a bishop. If a piece is in a queen’s path, it <strong>cannot</strong> go past it.</p>
      <img src="assets/images/queenmoves.png" class="board-demo">
      <h3>Kings</h3>
      <img src="../assets/pieces/wK.svg" width="80">
      <img src="../assets/pieces/bK.svg" width="80">
      <p>Kings can move one square in any direction. Kings cannot move into check and have to be protected when they are put in check by the opposing side.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="assets/images/kingmoves.png" class="board-demo">
        <figcaption>(Note how the king cannot move to the square attacked by the pawn)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Pawns</h3>
      <img src="../assets/pieces/wP.svg" width="80">
      <img src="../assets/pieces/bP.svg" width="80">
      <p>Pawns can move two squares forward on their first move, and one square forward for every move after. Pawns can only capture pieces that are one square diagonally to the upper left or one square diagonally to the upper right. When a pawn gets to the opposite end of the board, it can be promoted to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight.</p>
