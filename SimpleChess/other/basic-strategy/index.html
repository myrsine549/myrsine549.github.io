    <h1>Basic Strategy</h1>
    <h3><em>Things to keep in mind</em></h3>

    <div class="text-container">
      <p>Some very basic components of chess strategy include controlling the center, getting active pieces, achieving king safety and gaining a material advantage. In general, players should start the game by fighting for the center. A first move such as pushing the kingâ€™s pawn forward by two squares is seen as being beneficial as it immediately controls key center squares. After initially occupying the center with pawns, the knights and bishops should generally be developed in order to reinforce them. This brings us into the next point, which is piece activity. After gaining some degree of control in the center, the focus should be put on maximizing the agility of the pieces. Moving knights and bishops off their starting squares is a good way to increase the attack surface of these pieces. Throughout the game, players should also focus on king safety. The concept here is simple; if the king is tucked away and protected, it has a lower chance of getting checkmated. Castling your king is an effective and easy way to increase king safety. Finally, players should try to gain a material advantage on their opponent. If a player has more material than their opponent, they will be able to develop larger attacks and thus have a higher chance of delivering checkmate. In chess, each piece has a different value. Pawns are worth one point, knights and bishops are worth three points, rooks are worth five points, and queens are worth nine points. Generally, the player with the higher point sum is doing better in the game. For this reason, players should prioritize their pieces based on their respective point values.</p>
