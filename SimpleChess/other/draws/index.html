    <h1>Possible Draws</h1>
    <h3><em>How a game can become a draw</em></h3>

      <p>A game can be drawn in a couple of different ways. The first way is by reaching a stalemate. A position is declared a stalemate if a player has no legal moves on their turn and their king is not in check. Another way a game can be drawn is through a dead position. A position is declared dead when neither side can make any progress towards checkmating the opponentâ€™s king. A draw due to insufficient checkmating material (pieces) is a good example of this. In the case of a board with two kings and no other pieces, for instance, it is obvious that neither side will be able to deliver a checkmate. Next, if the same position, with the same possible moves, has repeated three times over the course of the game, a draw can be called. Furthermore, a game can end in a draw through the fifty-move rule. A draw can be claimed through the fifty-move rule if both players have played out fifty moves without a pawn move or a capture of a piece. Finally, a game can end in a draw if, at any time, both players mutually agree to draw the game.</p>
